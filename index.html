			<p> <font face = "verdana"><!-- With the upcoming presidential election and the amount of current events involving police brutality and environmental issues, we 
			found it necessary to create a website that makes information on these topics easily available to young and new voters. It will no longer be overwhelming to
			google information and have to search through the various links that pop up on your screen. We've found a way to centralize all of this information briefly
			in the three topics below.-->
			While brainstorming ideas about our final project for Girls Who Code, chose an idea that we were passionate about, current events. Because our initial conversation
			included topics about presidential candidates, environmental issues, and human rights, we started to realize how uneducated we felt about current events. The internet
			allows us to have this information at our fingertips, but the amount of information becomes incredibly overwhelming for youth who are trying to become knowledgeable about
			current events. From this, we determined that the difficulty in finding simplified information causes many people to give up on following the news entirely. The goal for 
			our final product is to have a website that centralizes all of the necessary information by having interactive infographics, quizzes, and links to unbiased sources. We currently
			have infographics that provide coverage on police brutality and the drought in California. The links to the information is below once you click on the image.
